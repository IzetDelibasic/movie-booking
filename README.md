# Movie booking - Seminar project

This project was developed as part of the Web Development and Design subject at the Faculty of Information Technology. The aim of this project is to provide users with the ability to reserve seats in a cinema for various movies. The application utilizes HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript to implement its functionalities.

## Application Functionalities

### Viewing Available Seats
Users can view the available seats in the cinema on the website. Each seat is displayed on the screen with its seat number and price.

### Seat Reservation
Users can select their desired seats by clicking on them. After selection, the seat becomes reserved, and the reservation price automatically increases. The number of reserved seats is also updated.

### Viewing Price and Number of Reserved Seats
Users can see the current price of their reservations and the number of reserved seats in the cart on the screen.

### Cancelling a Reservation
Users can remove a reservation from a selected seat if they change their minds. This action will reduce the reservation price and free up the selected seat for other users.
